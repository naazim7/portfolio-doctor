        <h3>My Recipies </h3>
        <p class="reci-text">I make almost everything from scratch and maintain a bountiful organic garden in my front
            and back yard that produces year round, fresh seasonal vegetables, fruits and herbs. I realize cooking
            almost everything from scratch can be overwhelming and unrealistic for some, thus improvise and modify any
            recipe to your needs, taste and lifestyle. Cooking should not be stressful, but inspiring and exciting.</p>

                    <p class="brief-text">
                        Cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts. Like other
                        vegetables, they’re high in fiber and tend to be incredibly filling. What’s more, these
                        types of veggies generally contain decent amounts of protein. They’re not nearly as high in
                        protein as animal foods or legumes but still high compared to most vegetables. A combination
                        of protein, fiber and low energy density makes cruciferous vegetables the perfect foods to
                        include in your meals if you need to lose weight.</p>

                    <h3 class="reci-name">Whole Grains</h3>
                    <p class="brief-text">Though cereal grains have received a bad reputation in recent years, some
                        types are definitely healthy.

                        This includes some whole grains that are loaded with fiber and contain a decent amount of
                        protein.

                        Notable examples include oats, brown rice and quinoa.

                        Oats are loaded with beta-glucans, soluble fibers that have been shown to increase satiety and
                        improve metabolic health (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).

                        Both brown and white rice can contain significant amounts of resistant starch, particularly if
                        cooked and then allowed to cool afterward (36Trusted Source).</p>

                    <h3 class="reci-name">Leafy Greens</h3>
                    <p class="brief-text">Eating leafy greens is a great way to increase the volume of your meals,
                        without increasing the
                        calories. Numerous studies show that meals and diets with a low energy density make people eat
                        fewer calories overall.

                        Leafy greens are also incredibly nutritious and very high in many vitamins, antioxidants and
                        minerals, including calcium, which has been shown to aid fat burning in some studies</p>
